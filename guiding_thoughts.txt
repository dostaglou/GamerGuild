Initial Target Audience:
  Players of Pathfinder 2e comfortable with web-apps

How our audience uses the site:
  - A user stores character sheets so they don't have to track paper
    -- secondary goat: they use it for character creation
  - A user writes back stories for characters so they and others can track them
  - A user searches for other local players. 
  - A user messages other players
  - A user creates 'tables' wherein many players can gather
  - A user shares characters at a table so others can see them.
  - A user accesses an absent player's character sheet via the table.
  - A user shares or hides certain aspects of their character from others (GM vs Player)
  - A user creates a campaign wherein they write down various lore
  - A user can share campaign data, in part of full, to a table for easy reference by all.
